# Cerebro Predict

## Overview

Cerebro Predict is an innovative project designed to predict the likelihood of stroke based on various parameters using machine learning algorithms. Leveraging the power of Random Forest and Logistic Regression, this project aims to provide accurate and timely predictions for identifying individuals at risk of experiencing a stroke.

## Objective

The primary objective of Cerebro Predict is to develop a robust and reliable predictive model for stroke risk assessment. By analyzing a set of diverse parameters, the project aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals, enabling early intervention and personalized healthcare strategies.
